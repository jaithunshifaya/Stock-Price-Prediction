## Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a model that can predict future stock prices using past stock market trends. By leveraging LSTM, a type of recurrent neural network, the system captures time-series dependencies in stock data to generate accurate forecasts. The project also integrates real-time predictions and visualizations to enhance usability and decision-making.

## Features
